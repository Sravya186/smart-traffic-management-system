Database Design
Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System database is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve real-time traffic data, user information, reports, and route details.
The database supports scalable traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and user-generated incident reporting.

A relational database model is used to ensure data consistency, integrity, and efficient querying.

Database Objectives

Store user authentication and profile information

Maintain real-time and historical traffic data

Record congestion levels and accident reports

Support route optimization and ETA calculation

Enable user-based traffic reporting and feedback

Database Tables Description
1. Users Table

Stores information about registered users of the application.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
user_id	INT (PK)	Unique user identifier
name	VARCHAR(100)	User full name
email	VARCHAR(100)	User email address
password	VARCHAR(255)	Encrypted password
phone	VARCHAR(15)	Contact number
role	VARCHAR(20)	User/Admin
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Account creation time
2. Traffic_Data Table

Stores real-time and historical traffic information collected from sensors and APIs.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
traffic_id	INT (PK)	Unique traffic record
location	VARCHAR(255)	Road or area name
traffic_density	INT	Traffic intensity level
average_speed	FLOAT	Average vehicle speed
congestion_level	VARCHAR(50)	Low / Medium / High
recorded_time	TIMESTAMP	Time of data capture
3. Congestion_Areas Table

Stores frequently congested road segments.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
area_id	INT (PK)	Unique area ID
location	VARCHAR(255)	Congested location
severity	VARCHAR(50)	Congestion severity
last_updated	TIMESTAMP	Last update time
4. Route_Information Table

Stores optimized routes and travel estimates.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
route_id	INT (PK)	Route identifier
source	VARCHAR(100)	Starting location
destination	VARCHAR(100)	Ending location
distance	FLOAT	Distance in kilometers
estimated_time	FLOAT	Estimated travel time
traffic_status	VARCHAR(50)	Current traffic status
5. User_Reports Table

Stores traffic incidents reported by users.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
report_id	INT (PK)	Report identifier
user_id	INT (FK)	Reporting user
report_type	VARCHAR(50)	Accident / Jam / Roadblock
description	TEXT	Report details
location	VARCHAR(255)	Incident location
report_time	TIMESTAMP	Report submission time
Relationships Between Tables

Users ↔ User_Reports
One user can submit multiple traffic reports (One-to-Many)

Traffic_Data ↔ Congestion_Areas
Traffic data contributes to congestion identification

Route_Information ↔ Traffic_Data
Routes depend on real-time traffic conditions

Database Design Approach

Normalized up to 3rd Normal Form (3NF)

Primary keys ensure entity uniqueness

Foreign keys maintain referential integrity

Indexed columns used for faster queries on location and time

Tools Used

Database Design: MySQL / PostgreSQL

ER Diagram: Draw.io / Figma

Implementation: Android App Backend

Future Enhancements

Integration with AI/ML models for traffic prediction

Real-time database synchronization using cloud services

Storage of satellite and sensor-based traffic feeds
